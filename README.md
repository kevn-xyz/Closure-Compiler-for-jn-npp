# Closure-Compiler-for-jn-npp
A little script to minify the current view.
It opens a file with .min inserted before the last "." (eg. script.js -> script.min.js, script.1.5.6.js -> script.1.5.6.min.js).

# Installation Steps
1. You can grab the latest version of jn-npp from [here.](https://github.com/sieukrem/jn-npp-plugin/releases)
2. Once that is installed place `ClosureCompilerMinify.js` into `[Your notepad++ directory]\plugins\jN\includes\` (Its most likely `C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins\jN\includes` )
3. And then you should be good to go.
